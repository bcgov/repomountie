"This issue is a kind reminder that your repository has been inactive for 1 days. Some repositories are maintained in accordance with business requirements that infrequently change thus appearing inactive, and some repositories are inactive because they are unmaintained.

To help differentiate products that are unmaintained from products that do not require frequent maintenance, repomountie will open an issue whenever a repository has not been updated in 2 days.

- If this product is being actively maintained, please close this issue.
- If this repository isn't being actively maintained anymore, please archive this repository. Also, for bonus points, please add a \`dormant\` or \`retired\` life cycle badge.

Thank you for your help ensuring effective governance of our open-source ecosystem!
