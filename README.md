## About

The _repomountie_ is a GitHup application (bot) help ensure cultural niceties are respected.

## Usage

### Local Development

To run the bot locally ensure you have a `.env` file in the project root; see `env.example` for required contents. Once your environment is setup run the following command:

```console
npm run build && npm start
```

\* Pro Tip: You can generate a webhook secret with the command:

```console
openssl rand -hex 20
```

\* Pro Tip: Log levels are _trace_, _debug_ or _info_.

\* Pro Tip: You can use `smee.io` or perhaps `ngrok` to proxy GitHub events.

### Build

Use the OpenShift `build.json` template in this repo with the following (sample) command. The build is meant to be a CI process to confirm that a build can happen without error, that no code quality, security or test errors occur.

\* See the `build.json` template for other _optional_ parameters.

\*\* To build multiple branches you'll use the config file multiple times. This will create errors from the `oc` command output that can safely be ignored. For example: `Error from server (AlreadyExists): secrets "github" already exists`

// TODO:(jl) Add sample `oc` command.

### Deployment (OpenShift)

Use the OpenShift `deploy.json` template in this repo with the following (sample) command to build an environment (namesapce) and deploy the code and dependencies:

```console
oc process -f openshift/templates/deploy.json \
-p NAMESPACE=devhub-dev \
-p GITHUB_APP_ID=19327 \
-p GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET_VALUE=432bbe0466fda25cb55b4cee143eb9aaf3e7d8e6 \
-p GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_VALUE=$GITHUB_KEY \
-p NODE_ENV=production \
-p IMAGE_TAG=test | oc create -f -
```

| Parameter      | Optional | Description                     |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| APP_ID         | NO       | The GitHub APP ID               |
| WEBHOOK_SECRET | NO       | The GitHub Webhook secret       |
| PRIVATE_KEY    | NO       | The GiHub App private key       |
| LOG_LEVEL      | YES      | Default `debug`                 |
| NODE_ENV       | NO       | The node.js environment         |
| IMAGE_TAG      | NO       | Image tag to trigger deployment |

\* See the `deploy.json` template for other _optional_ parameters.
